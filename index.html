        <h1>Leash laws matter</h1>
        
        <p>Lots of cities and towns have leash laws. You might think they exist to keep the grass green or prevent people from getting muddy paw prints on their clothing. But those aren’t the real reasons behind leash laws.</p>
        
        <p>Leash laws exist to protect dogs and people from potentially dangerous encounters. Imagine you’ve just rescued a puppy. He’s shy. He’s tiny. And you’re out on your first walk together in the park. Suddenly, a big off-leash dog runs up to say hi. He’s friendly, but your little rescue pup doesn’t know that. He has spent his short life in stressful environments and hasn’t had time to learn that most dogs and people are nice.</p>
        
        <p>In this situation, your pup might tuck his tail and hide behind you. He might growl and lunge at the bigger dog. Maybe this prompts the bigger dog to turn and run away. Or, maybe it provokes him to bite your dog. Either way, this frustrating experience can be traumatic for your puppy and you.</p>
        
        <h2>Help keep dogs and people safe</h2>
        
        <p>Encounters like this aren’t just about puppies. Adult dogs who are recovering from trauma or surgery need space. So do shy dogs who just want to go for a walk without meeting other animals. There are even people who’ve experienced dog attacks and feel anxious or scared when close to unfamiliar animals.</p>
        
        <p>All of these dogs and humans deserve safe, comfortable places to get fresh air and exercise. That’s why it’s important to keep your dog on a leash in public, even if he’s friendly. <strong>Especially</strong> if he’s friendly.</p>
